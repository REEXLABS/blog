Welcome (back) on [REEX Lab's](https://reexlabs.com) technical blog. Today's post is the second part of a series titled
*Fom Zero To MVP* where we share our thoughts on how to build a product from nothing else than a vague idea, from a developer perspective.
In the <a href="/posts/from-zero-to-mvp" target="_blank">first part</a> we talked about POCs and MVPs. In this one, we will go over
how to plan the development of your MVP. The different steps involved in the process and best practices to be productive without hurting
the MVP's performance, because even if an MVP is meant to be really simple, it should still offer a decent user experience so that early users
will want to see the full product. Without further a do, let's get started.

Building an MVP is nothing really different from building an app. The only difference should be the time and effort put in  it. You want to build your
MVP in the shortest amount of time possible without using too much resources. You definitely don't want to spend too much time on a project for it to fail later.
That is the whole purpose of the MVP, to determine if users like the product idea and if it will be profitable to spend more time and money on building that product.

Now let's talk more as developers. As we said earlier, a MVP is just an app, so the steps involved in building one are the same for any other app.

## Tech Stack choice
Remember we said that the MVP development should be done as fast as possible while making sure not to hurt the product's performance. That also applies in the choice of 
your tech stack. For example if you want your final product to be performant, memory safe and reliable for a long time, you should choose languages such as Go or Rust. But
making software in these languages take more time than using languages such as Python or TypeScript as they are easier to write. You should choose the language with which you
are the most productive. So if you know Rust and TypeScript but are more productive with TypeScript, it will be a good choice to write your MVP in TypeScript as long as it doesn't
affect your app's performance. If only Rust can make your MVP usable, then it doesn't matter if you are more familiar with TypeScript or any other language, because the MVP should
be good enough to make early users want to see the full product. So to summarize, while choosing the stack for your MVP you should first think about a stack that can deliver a great
user experience and after that you think about productivity, how fast can you release the app if you use that specific stack.

## Analyze and feedback
Once your MVP is out in the wild, you should have a way to collect feedback from your users. You could create a community Discord server, ask questions on your website or use forms and
surveys to try and get what users think about the app. You should also get other developers to try out the app (if the app is not primarly for developers) and see if they can give you
any advice on how to improve the product's performance and user experience. Nobody likes spam, so you should collect information sure, but in a way that won't make your users feel overwhelmed
by you.

## Iterate and improve
Based on the feedback you receive from your users, you can now adapt and modify your app to meet their need. Keep in mind that we are still talking about the MVP here. It's still a prototype
that you are improving to create a stable one. Use feedback from your community, friends, family, anyone that tried the app and gave you their thoughts on it counts. Sometimes people will
find use cases for your app that you didn't even think about, when that happens, if the use case is legal, go for it, add new features, update existing ones, doing that you can already notice
features that you could make users pay for and start thinking about pricing if you haven't before. Iterate and improve!

## Conclusion
If everything went well, you should now have a solid MVP that lacks a few things before you call it a full blown product, and that is what it was all about from the beginning, build something
that is very close to the complete product and that will make users want to see the actual product. At that point in time you should have enough feedback to know what the product should look like
to gain more users and keep the current ones, and start building it. Maybe using a different stack more inclined towars performance than productivity or using the same.

That's it, it was a short series of post in which we shared our thoughts on how to build a full blown product from an idea. We hope you liked it. If we have something to tell us, we would love to hear it
, don't be shy and tell us in the comment section down below. Thanks for reading and we will see you in the next post.
