Welcome (back) on [REEX Lab's](https://reexlabs.com) technical blog. Today's post is the very first one of a series titled
*Fom Zero To MVP* where we share our thoughts on how to build a product from nothing else than a vague idea, from a developer perspective.
In this very first part of the series, we will talk about POCs and MVPs and what they really are. And we will set the tone for the next part. Without further
a do, let's get right into it.

## Step 1: The idea
Allright, we can all agree that you can't build a product out of thin air, you need an idea, a concept, something you want to realize. 
The starting point of all great products is the idea. Now there is nothing much you can do about this step, some people are kind of gifted in a
way that they have a lot of great ideas, some might have less. But whether you are the kind to have an idea for the next billion dollar
product every two minutes or not, one great way to find things to build is by studying. Studying existing products, or specific fields to find gaps
awaiting to be filled. This step is the one on which you have the less power, because even if you have a great idea, sometimes you just don't feel
like even starting to build it compared to some goofy ideas that get you excited. The most passionate you are about the product you want to
build, the better it will be.


## Step 2: The Proof Of Concept
Now you have your idea. Let's say you want to build a todo list app that can be updated by the power of the mind. Time is money, and you do not want to be
wasting time trying to build something that can't be. You can not be posting ads or looking for investors for your app if you don't even know HOW to build it
yet or even if it can be built. This is when the Proof Of Concept fits in, it's role is to determine IF your idea can be turned into a concept. The goal is to
make the main feature of your app work, in our case it's controlling a todo list with our minds. The Proof Of Concept should prove that you CAN connect one's
mind to a web/mobile/desktop app, and then read their thoughts to create and update todos on the list. If you manage to make it work, you got your proof of concept.
A POC doesn't have to be an app, most of the time, what we do @[REEX](https://reexlabs.com) is to write a sample script or quickly make something in a code playground
online. Once we manage to get the main feature of our product idea, we know we can move on to the next step.

## Step 3: The MVP
This step is the most important out of the three listed here, and it also contains other steps. A Minimal Viable Product is the smallest possible version of your grand idea that
you can show people and convince them to use, without embarrassing yourself too much." In other words, it's like showing people a half-baked cake that's missing some ingredients
and might not taste great, but is still enough to get their attention and show them the potential of what you're trying to create. It's a bit like a magic trick - if you can convince
people to buy into your MVP, you can use their feedback to improve and refine the product until it's ready for the big time.

We will wrap things up here for now. In the next part we will talk about how to plan the development of your MVP. Keep in mind that in this scenario, we assume you are a developer and you
will be building your idea whether it's solo or in a team. So maybe some things we will say won't apply to people from other fields.

We hope you like this post, tell us how you feel about all this in the comment section, we would love hearing from you. Until next time.
