# Hello World. 

Joseph, from REEX Labs here. I will be writting more of the articles you will be reading here.
In this very first post on this blog, I wanted to share with you how we build (or will be building) software solutions at REEX.
Without further a do, let's get into this.

As a **Research** company, we pretty much build everything and anything that comes to our mind. But we have a pattern that we follow for each of our projects

## Step 1: Excalidraw
This is where everything starts. Every time we start a new project, what we do first is hop in a call and open up our favorite white board: <a target="_blank" href="https://excalidraw.com">Excalidraw</a>.
Once there, we discuss what we are building, why we are building it and how we will build it. We draw out the architecture of the app and decide what language, database and technologies will be used.
If the app needs a UI, we also draw mockups. Basically, at the end of that one call, our white board has pretty much everything we need to start building our app and quickly produce a MVP. Which leads us to step two

## Step 2: The MVP
This is the most important step for us. We want to get our product out in the wild as quickly as possible and the best way to achieve that is to first aim for a MVP. In case you don't know, a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) 
is a version of the product that just consists of a minimum set of features that are necessary to satisfy early users and get feedback for further product development. The goal of the MVP is to quickly test the product idea
 and gather feedback from users with minimal investment in time and resources.

Usually it takes us less than a month to release a MVP depending on the complexity of the product and the number of people working on it.

## Step 3: The First Release
Once our MVP built, we will likely be announcing the release of our new product on our social medias and will also write a dedicated blog post to talk about the product in depth. In the blog post we will also release the Excalidraw board that started it all

### We Love OSS
All our apps will be open sourced unless the app concept does not belong to us and the client required the source to stay closed

That's pretty much it. Once our product out, we get feedback from our users and based on that feedback, determine if we will be building a fully fledged version of that product and maintain it.

## Final words
REEX is still a young company and we have much to learn and experience, but we believe in our passion for software development to lead us very far in this adventure. Follow us on <a target="_blank" href="https://excalidraw.com">GitHub</a>. Until next time
